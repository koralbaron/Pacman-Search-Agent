# Pacman-Search-And-Multi-Agent-Search 
## Description
### Search
A project according to Berkeley course task: [Project1: Search](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/fa20/project1/#introduction) <br>
Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to collect food efficiently.
In this project I implemented the following search algorithms:
* Depth First Search (DFS)
* Breadth First Search (BFS)
* Uniform Cost Search
* A Star (A*)

### Multi Agent Search
A project according to Berkeley course task: [Project2: Multi-Agent Search](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs188/su21/project2/) <br>
Design agents for the classic version of Pacman (including ghosts).
In this project I implemented the following search algorithms:
* Minimax
* Expectimax
* Evaluation function
